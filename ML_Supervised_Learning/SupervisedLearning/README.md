**CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning.**

This assignment seeks to understand the predictive and computational characteristics of five supervised learning algorithms ( Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest neighbors) which are implemented and analyzed on two Datasets Sourced from Kaggle (Both Dataset exists on Kaggle & UCI Machine Learning Repository).

**Prerequisites -**

You need to install python 3.6 and the following packages:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter

**Running the Classifiers -**

The notebooks and datasets can be downloaded using this git command (The repository is public):

git clone https://github.gatech.edu/vkoti7/Ml_CS7641.git

To run any algorithm on any dataset, please open the corresponding notebook(for each Dataset) and run all cells in order (Run All can be done on Run tab).
